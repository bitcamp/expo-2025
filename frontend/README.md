# Frontend 

We are using Nuxt3 + Vue3. Nuxt is built on top of Vue and provides nice-to-have features that Vue doesn't automatically come with, incuding but not limited to:
- Static site generation (production)
- Server-side rendering
- Advanced Routing (file page routing!)
- Auto imports

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```

### Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
